Carbon footprint tracker
**Problem Statement (Carbon Footprint Tracker):**
Every day, individuals unwittingly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions through their choices—commutes, meals, and household energy use, but lack clear visibility into the true carbon cost of these activities. Without real-time feedback or motivation, it’s hard to form sustainable habits or track progress. This app lets users log routine actions (e.g., driving, eating, heating), taps into open APIs (like OpenWeather for heating estimates and USDA for food emissions) and generates a personalized CO₂ dashboard. By layering in gamified milestones and social sharing, this solution will empower users to measure, reduce and celebrate lower-carbon lifestyles.
